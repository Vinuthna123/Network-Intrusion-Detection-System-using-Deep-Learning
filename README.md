The developed Artificial neural network is capable of classifying network traffic flow into normal or a cyber attack.

Software and technologies used:
Python 3.9
Tensorflow 2.5.0
Wireshark
Cicflowmeter 4.0
 
PreRequisites for deployment:

Download the python notebook.
Install Wireshark and Cicflowmeter 4.0(from https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter.git).
Run wireshark, capture the traffic and save it as .pcap file.
Open Cicflowmeter through command prompt and load the .pcap file in offline mode.
The file gets converted to .csv file.

Execution:

Use the obtained csv file, load it in the notebook and predict using the model(example file is tested in the notebook).
